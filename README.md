# OpenFisca Core (Energy Security Safeuard FORK)

This is a forked version of [openfisca/openfisca-core](https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-core)

### What does this repo do?
- The Energy Security Safeuard deployment of OpenFisca draws from new and in-development features of openfisca_core. These new features live in multiple different branches of the openfisca/openfisca-core repository.
- This repo allows the ESS team to merge all of the required branches into one repo.
- We can then install openfisca-core from this repo, and we'll have access to all of the new/in-development features
